    "I had the pleasure of designing the poster and flyer for the summer 2023
    production of the So1Theater theater group (whos website I also reworked).
    I tried to create an outstanding and attention grabing yet simple design that
    ties in with the theme of the play ('Twelve Angry Men')."

    "Through an university class I got in contact with app interface design. Our
    app was a time management tool with fokus on balancing work and free time. The choosen Art Déco style
    with its symmetrical and balanced elements supports the goal of having a good
    work-life-balance."

    tools and programms."

    "In early 2023 I started doing analogue photography as a hobby. Through this
    I sharpened my sight for composition. I take my camera with me to every new place I visit, but also
    go on strolls through my hometown to find captivating everyday motives."

    twelveAngryMen: "12 ANGRY MEN"
    tamtext1: 
      "I have been a part of the So1Theater student theater group in Augsburg 
      since 2023. For our 2024 summer production “Twelve Angry Men” I took the 
      task of designing the poster and flyer for the play. I want to explain 
      the process behind the design a bit in the following text."
    tamtext2: 
      "The play is based on an American movie from the 1950s. Twelve jurors 
      must decide whether an 18-year-old immigrant is guilty of murdering his father 
      or not. In the beginning everyone is sure of the boy’s guilt – everyone but 
      one juror. During the following often-heated discussions the ulterior motives behind the 
      juror's decicions come to light."
    tamtext3:
      "I started by looking at possible viusal elements for the design. I skimmed 
      through the text and collected everything that could be of interest - from knives
      to statues of Justicia and various other motives. In the same step I also 
      looked at movie and theater play posters to get inspiration and 
      pick up common motives among the different designs, like very strong contrasts
      and setting appart one of twelve elements."
    tamtext4:
      "I chose colors with maximum contrast – red, white and black. Those not only 
      stand out amongst the huge number of posters hanging around the campus but also 
      reflect the partialy opposite oppinions of the jurors. I also picked a knive as the 
      center element. On the poster it seperates the people, again showing how divided 
      the jurors are on the matter. The knive also creates a gap between the people on 
      the poster, showing once more, how divided the jurors are and how their different
      opinions seem unbridgeable. Almost all the elements on the poster are tilted, 
      causing motion and unrest, as well as discomfort."
    tamtext5:
      "With every element on the poster, I tried to emulate the feeling and content of the play."
    tamtext6:
      "The flyer consists of the poster on the front and a short text about the play on the back.
      Elements from the front continue on the back, like the red gaps and the uneven part at the
      bottom."

      "Sadly I was absent for the next production and the shows in January 2025 because I was 
      studying abroard in Norway. But this didn't stop me to still contribute something to the 
      group."
    cdtext2:
      "The theater group has two designers - Carina Huber (klick the following Link to visite her 
      Instagram profile: [Link to <a href='https://www.instagram.com/cleopatra_mueller/?igsh=ajhmZWhobDE3bDFl#'>Link</a>)
      and me - and for this production we split up the design tasks between us 
      two. Carina took care of the poster and the flyers while I designed the programm booklet and 
      the free tickets."
    cdtext3:
      "But first let's get some information about the play: Nearing death Reece Wells wants to set the record
      straight about the misdoings of him and his business partner and friend Julian Goodman. Not only that, but
      in order to safe their business Julian killed both of Reeces wifes! When Reece realises this, he decides
      to write a confession. But this confession needs to be signed by two witnesses. Since he lives in a hotel
      under constant surveilance from Julian, he calls in for a dominatrix - Poopay. One thing leads to another 
      and Poopay is caught up in a confusing time travel in which she has to save not only herself, but also 
      Reeces two wifes from the homicidal Julian."
    cdtext4:
      "At the beginning of the production it wasn't clear who would design what, so I also made some drafts."
