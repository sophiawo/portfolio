    "I had the pleasure of designing the poster and flyer for the summer 2023
    production of the So1Theater theater group (whos website I also reworked).
    I tried to create an outstanding and attention grabing yet simple design that
    ties in with the theme of the play ('Twelve Angry Men')."

    "Through an university class I got in contact with app interface design. Our
    app was a time management tool with fokus on balancing work and free time. The choosen Art Déco style
    with its symmetrical and balanced elements supports the goal of having a good
    work-life-balance."

    "In early 2023 I started doing analogue photography as a hobby. Through this
    I sharpened my sight for composition. I take my camera with me to every new place I visit, but also
    go on strolls through my hometown to find captivating everyday motives."

    twelveAngryMen: "12 ANGRY MEN"
    tamtext1: 
      "I have been a part of the So1Theater student theater group in Augsburg 
      since 2023. For our 2024 summer production “Twelve Angry Men” I took the 
      task of designing the poster and flyer for the play. I want to explain 
      the process behind the design a bit in the following text."
    tamtext2: 
      "The play is based on an Amercan movie from the 1950s. Twelve jurors 
      must decide whether an 18-year-old immigrant is hulty of murdering his father 
      or not. In the beginning everyone is sure of the boy’s guilt – everyone but 
      one juror. During the often-heated discussions the ulterior motives behind the 
      jurors decicions come to light."
    tamtext3:
      "I started by looking at possible viusal elements for the design. I scimmed 
      through the text and collected everything that could be of interest. In the 
      same step I also looked at movie and theater play posters to get inspired and 
      pick up common motives among the different designs."
    tamtext4:
      "I chose colors with maximum contrast – red, white and black. Those not only 
      stand out amongst the huge number of posters hanging around the campus but also 
      reflect the partialy opposite oppinions of the jurors. I picked a knive as the 
      center element. On the poster it seperates the people, again showing how divided 
      the jurors are on the matter. Almost all the elements on the poster are tilted, 
      causing motion and unrest, as well as discomfort."
    tamtext5:
      "With every element on the poster, I tried to emulate the feeling and content of the play."
